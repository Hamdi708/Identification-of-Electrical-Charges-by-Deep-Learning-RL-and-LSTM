# Energy Consumption Prediction and Appliance Identification

Energy supply and environmental mitigation are among the major challenges facing the planet today. Consequently, priority policies must be implemented to meet the growing demand for energy while simultaneously reducing the ecological footprint. In this context, strategies promoting rational and intelligent energy consumption, efforts to improve the efficiency of current energy systems, and the integration of innovative technologies are essential to find feasible and reliable solutions.

Our project focuses on the identification and prediction of different electrical loads in a residential house. Specifically, we aim to disaggregate the general load curve to estimate the status of each household appliance. To achieve this, we have implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm based on a recurrent neural network, resulting in a highly accurate database.
